# Match One (Blueprints)

[Match One](https://github.com/sschmid/Match-One) is a simple Unity3D example project to show how to use
[Entitas](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp), a super fast Entity Component System (ECS) specifically made for C# and Unity,
developed by Simon Schmid (Wooga) and open-source developers.

This example extends Match One by using [Entitas Blueprints](https://github.com/npruehs/Entitas-Blueprints-CSharp)
for configuring the game board elements.
